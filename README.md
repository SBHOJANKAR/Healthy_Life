# Healthy_Life
The website is to help 65+ years old people to live healthier and better life.

The Work I have done :

I have built a website to showcase my idea to make 65+ years old people's lives easier using Bootstrap and store details of patients in the database. 
The whole code and files of the website is in the main branch of my repository.

The idea :

A major priority is to make healthcare easily available to age-old people. 
This will be done by allocating the tips of nutrition and exercise tips.
Via respective communities, they can build their own programs to have fun.
If they have any queries they can contact us.
Thus the main idea is to connect 65+ age-old people and live a healthier life.
Note: 1. The screenshots of websites are stored in the "Screenshots" file in the main branch.
